I am excited to apply for the Junior/Mid Full-Stack Software Engineer role at Track Titan after hearing about the opportunity from our mutual friend Dan Page.

Track Titan does a great job of collecting and visualising data, which leads to real improvements for usersâ€™ track times. I am keen to contribute to improving this data visualisation to enable users to shave even more seconds off their laps.

I have a strong foundation in building and testing data-driven applications using TypeScript, NextJS, and NodeJS. I would love the opportunity to deepen my technical skills and expand my knowledge across the full tech stack.

In my current role as a project manager at a healthcare company supported by VC funding, Iâ€™m accustomed to adapting in a fast-paced, high-growth environment. Iâ€™m eager to bring the same hard work and dedication to contribute to Track Titanâ€™s growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to delivering an outstanding platform for users.
